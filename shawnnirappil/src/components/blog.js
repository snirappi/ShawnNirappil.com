                        When building strength, you put stress onto your body. This stress breaks down the body, then gets repaired, better able to handle loads in the future.
                        This is on a fundamental level how all growth occurs. Stress is endured, then growth happens. Rarely does this process go without significant amounts of pain.

                        For whatever it is that you are trying to improve at, you will need to take on pain. You will drive yourself to the depths of pain - physically, emotionally, mentally, to grow.
                        Do your stretches, get ready to wince. Talk to that attractive person, bench 315 pounds, have that conversation with your dad.

                        All those dark thoughts about yourself buried deep within will come to the surface, to confront you.

                        It’ll hurt, but it’ll make you that much stronger.
